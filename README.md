# Image Processing & Checksum Verification 🖼️

This project is a C++ application designed to read images, compute checksums, and compare image data for validation or analysis. It includes efficient file handling, checksum verification, and comparison functionalities.

📌 Features

Image Reading: Processes image files using imageReader.cpp.

Checksum Calculation: Computes checksums for validation (checkSums.cpp).

Image Comparison: Compares image data to detect differences (compare.cpp).

Modular Design: Uses a structured approach with separate modules for clarity and efficiency.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Build System: Makefile

Core Components:

imageReader.cpp – Reads and processes image files.

checkSums.cpp – Generates checksum values for image verification.

compare.cpp – Compares image data to find discrepancies.

main.cpp – Entry point that integrates all modules.

🚀 How to Build and Run
